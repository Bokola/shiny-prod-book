# DevOps Philosophy & Tooling

DevOps is a self-help philosophy for IT and software development teams that work together. It seeks to address the following problems:

- Deployments/releases are high-risk events
- It takes a long time to deliver new features to customers
- There is no visibility into how code is deployed into production, therefore it is impossible to know what to optimize or fix in the system and/or people who seek to improve portions of workflow are likely not addressing true bottlenecks.
- Dev and Ops have seemingly conflicting goals and objectives

The Fix (ref: The DevOps Handbook): 

1. Accelerate the delivery of work from Development to Operations to customers
2. Commit to evolving ever safer systems of work through feedback
3. Promote a high-trust culture and embrace continual learning and experimentation (risk-taking) in daily work

### Feature Toggles (Dark Launch)

#### User meta-data

Shiny applications can access the username and groups of the current user through the session parameter of the shinyServer function.

Groups meta-data is populated when using password, or OAuth authentication. It is not populated with LDAP, PAM, or proxy authentication.

```
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  output$username <- reactive({
    session$user
  })
  
  output$groups <- reactive({
    session$groups
  })
})
```

Your application could use this information to display customized messages or to enable functionality for a specific subset of users.

### Shiny Application Usage (Instrumentation)

RStudio Connect exposes usage information about shiny applications that will tell you which ones have been used, by whom and for how long. It is available via an API that may be used by administrators or publishers. Publishers may retrieve information about their own applications only.

More information about using the API is included in the historical information chapter of the RStudio Connect Admin Guide.
