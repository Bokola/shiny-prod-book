# Introduction to the Application {#app-intro}

## Every Application has an Origin Story

Data Scientists at RStudio University have discovered that there are trackable traits and behaviors students engage in that have been predictive of the desired 4-year graduation track.

They have built a shiny application that can be used by the very data-savvy advisors at this illustrious institution to identify students in need of guidance and show them the top behavioral factors driving individual predictions coming out of the model.

The POC was a smashing success - but now _the advisors actually want to use this thing for real_.

### Activity: Explore the Application

Open the POC Application
Run the Application
Explore the Application code

1. Are there any parts of the application code that don't make sense?
2. Brainstorm: what qualifies as production?
3. Brainstorm: 5 things to consider when bringing this application into production.

Discussion

- Is this app ready for production?
- What insights would be useful to have before taking this app into production?
- What tools currently exist that would help us run tests to gain these insights?

**Create a checklist for taking this (any?) application into production**

- What is your current process for taking applications into production?
