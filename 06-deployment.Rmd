[User Guide Resource: Collaboration](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing.html#collaboration)

Some data products will have multiple authors and collaborators who are responsible for managing the content deployed to RStudio Connect. The first step to collaboration is sharing and working together on code. We recommend using a version control tool like Git to coordinate collaboration across many users.
