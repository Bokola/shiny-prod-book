They have built a shiny application that can be used by the very data-savvy advisors at this illustrious institution to identify students in need of guidance and show them the top behavioral factors driving individual predictions coming out of the model. The POC was a smashing success - but now the advisors actually want to use this thing for real. 3.1.1 Activity: Explore the Application Open the POC Application Run the Application Explore the Application code Are there any parts of the application code that don’t make sense? Brainstorm: what qualifies as production? Brainstorm: 5 things to consider when bringing this application into production. Discussion Is this app ready for production? What insights would be useful to have before taking this app into production? What tools currently exist that would help us run tests to gain these insights? Create a checklist for taking this (any?) application into production What is your current process for taking applications into production? "],
